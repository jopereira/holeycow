to be used to build a shared-storage cluster.

The HoleyCoW project is a reasearch project at the Computer Science and
Technology Center at the University of Minho, by José Pereira, Luís Soares
and Luciano Rocha. Work leading to this project was partially funded by
FEDER through FCT by project Pastramy (PTDC/EIA/72405/2006), Bolsa de
Doutoramento (SFRH/BD/31114/2006), and EuroTux Informática S.A. We also
thank all the GORDA team at the U. Minho.
