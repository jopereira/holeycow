HoleyCoW allows replicated shared-nothing software (e.g. a DBMS server)
to be used to build a shared-storage cluster.

HoleyCoW-Xen version allows to run the algorithm with XEN instead of MYSQL.

HoleyCoW-Xen project is a reasearch project at the Computer Science and
Technology Center at the University of Minho, by José Pereira and João Paulo.
Work leading to this project was partially funded by FEDER through FCT by 
project Pastramy (PTDC/EIA/72405/2006).
